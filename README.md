# About This Repository

Originally, this repository served as a collection of my solutions for Codeforces and HackerRank. However, I realized that simply storing answers wasn't making the most of this resource. Now, I've decided to transform this repository into a comprehensive reference for myself and others interested in problem-solving strategies.

Here, I will share detailed explanations of how I approach and solve problems, as well as insights into my study techniques for competitive programming. This marks a fresh start for me as I begin solving problems on Codeforces and LeetCode using JavaScript. I hope this helps others who are on a similar journey.
